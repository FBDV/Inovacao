# Inovacao

Woman dies in large numbers in developing countries because they do not have the proper Pre-neonatal care. 
There is an ultrasound being developed (final steps) in Holland that is light and mobile enough to be carry in a backpack while still giving good quality of images. 
Attach it to a Tablet and you have a mobile recording system for Pre-neonatal care. 
A WEB solution will automatically upload the exams and make it available to doctors (volunteers) around the world to create a report (translated to any language available on Google Translator). The health care agent on his return visit to the women will tell her what the procedures for a safe and peaceful pregnancy are.
